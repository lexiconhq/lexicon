The Lexicon Discourse plugin provides support for integrating Discourse's email notifications with your Lexicon-powered mobile app. Our plugin modifies links in specific Discourse emails so that when a relevant link is tapped and the user has your Lexicon-powered mobile app installed, it will open the app to the relevant topic or post. Otherwise, it will fall back to opening the topic in the device's web browser as it normally would.

This section of the documentation offers step-by-step instructions to integrate email deep linking into your Discourse site so that your users have a more seamless experience with your Lexicon-powered mobile app.
