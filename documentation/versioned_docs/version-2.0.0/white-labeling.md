The Lexicon Mobile App allows you to customize its appearance through a process known as **White Labeling**.

If you're unfamiliar with this term, it's essentially the process of branding an existing application specifically for your users.

White Labeling allows you to configure the app with your own logo, app icon, color theme, fonts, and so on.

The idea is that your users won't know that the Lexicon team built this app. Its appearance will be completely customized to your brand.
