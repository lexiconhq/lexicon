As of Lexicon version 2.0.0, a custom Discourse plugin is available to provide a more seamless mobile integration between Discourse and your Lexicon-powered mobile app.

The plugin currently offers two key features:

- **Push notifications**: support for native push notifications on user's mobile devices, according to relevant activity on your Discourse site. Powered by Expo's [push notifications service](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/).
- **Email deep linking**: custom deep links in emails from Discourse, allowing users to seamlessly launch your Lexicon-powered mobile app directly from their mobile email client.
