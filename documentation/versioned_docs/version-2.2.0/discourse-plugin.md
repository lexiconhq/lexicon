As of Lexicon version 2.0.0, a custom Discourse plugin is available to provide a more seamless mobile integration between Discourse and your Lexicon-powered mobile app.

The plugin offers two key features for version 2.0.0:

- **Push notifications**: support for native push notifications on user's mobile devices, according to relevant activity on your Discourse site. Powered by Expo's [push notifications service](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/overview/).
- **Email deep linking**: custom deep links in emails from Discourse, allowing users to seamlessly launch your Lexicon-powered mobile app directly from their mobile email client.

As of Lexicon version 2.2.0, we have added more features to the Discourse Lexicon plugin:

The plugin now offers three additional features:

- **Sign in with Apple**: Support for Lexicon-powered mobile apps to enable login using an Apple account.
- **Login with Link**: Support for Lexicon-powered mobile apps to enable login using a link from an email without needing to input a password in the app. [Login with Link documentation](login-with-link/intro.md)
- **Activation with Link**: Support for activating an account after sign-up for Lexicon-powered mobile apps.
