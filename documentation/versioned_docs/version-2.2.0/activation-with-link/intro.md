The Lexicon Discourse plugin provides support for integrating Discourse's email activation with your Lexicon-powered mobile app. Our plugin modifies links in specific Discourse activation emails account so that when a relevant link is tapped and the user has your Lexicon-powered mobile app installed, it will open the app and automatically activate account and log the user in.

This section of the documentation offers step-by-step instructions to integrate activation with link into your Discourse site so that your users have a more seamless experience with your Lexicon-powered mobile app.
