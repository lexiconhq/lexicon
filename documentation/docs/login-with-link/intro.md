The Lexicon Discourse plugin provides support for integrating Discourse's email login with your Lexicon-powered mobile app. Our plugin modifies links in Discourse login emails so that when a relevant link is tapped, and the user has your Lexicon-powered mobile app installed, it will open the app and automatically log the user in.

This section of the documentation offers step-by-step instructions to integrate this login functionality into your Discourse site, providing your users with a more seamless experience with your Lexicon-powered mobile app.
