title: Discourse Features Support
---

Below is a table of Discourse features which provides the details and current status about the support for a given feature in the **Lexicon Mobile App**.

If we missed one, or anything looks out of date here, don't hesitate to submit a Pull Request which updates the table.

Is the feature you love not supported? [Reach out to us](mailto:support@kodefox.com) to discuss how we can bring it to life for you.

#### Our General Approach to Feature Support

Much of our initial focus was on using-facing features, rather than administrative features.

This is why, for example, users can select categories for their topics, but administrators are unable to create new categories from within the mobile app.

For this reason, most admin tasks are still best accomplished using the Discourse web app on a larger device.
