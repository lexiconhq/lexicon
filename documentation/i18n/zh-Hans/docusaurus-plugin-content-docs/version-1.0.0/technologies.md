### 100% React Native and TypeScript built on Expo

Lexicon was built, and is maintained, with a single code baseâ€”meaning that bug fixes, improvements, and new features will (in most cases) automatically apply to both iOS and Android.

### GraphQL-based API

Developers who wish to contribute to (or fork) Lexicon can do so with all the benefits of GraphQL. For more information, check out [Concepts and Architecture](concepts#prose-discourse-through-graphql).

### White Labeling Support

White Label the Lexicon Mobile App to give your users the familiar look and feel of your brand. Learn more in [White Labeling](white-labeling).

### Painless integration with existing Discourse instances

Getting started is as easy as spinning up a new server for the Prose GraphQL API, and pointing it at your Discourse instance. No changes are required on your Discourse instance itself.

However, to provide an [optimal experience](optimal) with features like Tagging and Topic Excerpts, you will need to make some light adjustments.

This is covered in detail in [Deploying Prose](deployment).
