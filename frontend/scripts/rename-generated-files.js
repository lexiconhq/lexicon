// This is a temporary helper script to aid in the migration from
// apollo-tools to graphql-code-generator.
//
// The goal is to require as little of a refactor as possible of the actual code,
// i.e. configure graphql-code-generator to produce the same output as apollo-tools was.
//
// The problem this script solves is that src/graphql/server has all of its filenames
// in camelCase, but the codebase currently imports from src/generatedAPI/server as if
// all of the generated filenames are in PascaleCase.
//
// Despite tinkering with graphql-code-generator settings & plugins quite a bit, there
// didn't seem to be a good way to rename all the files to PascalCase.
//
// This script accomplishes that.
//
// This script should be deleted and removed from codegen.yaml once we've refactored
// the codebase to more fully embrace the features of graphql-code-generator.

// NOTE: to debug this file as it runs with graphql-code-generator, go into codegen.yml
// and change this line:
// ` - node ./scripts/rename-generated-files.js`
// to this:
// ` - node ./scripts/rename-generated-files.js > output.txt 2>&1
