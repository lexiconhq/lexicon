/**
 * ## About the `plugins.ts` file
 *
 * `plugins` are intended to be used with our GraphQL server, GraphQL Yoga, which
 * internally leverages Envelop for its plugin system.
 *
 * Envelop is a library that serves as a GraphQL plugin system.
 *
 * `graphql-authz` is one such plugin that is compatible with Envelop. It provides a
 * powerful and flexible authorization solution.
 *
 * `graphql-authz` works by wrapping the GraphQL execution phase. This allows you to run
 * authorization logic before and after this phase, via Pre-exec Rules and Post-exec Rules.
 *
 * - The pre-execution phase is for static auth rules based on context & input.
 * - The post-execution phase is for flexible auth rules based on the execution result.
 *
 * This is currently the only plugin that we require for this project. We use it to ensure
 * that the user is authenticated in order to perform certain queries and mutations.
 *
 * When a request does not include authenticated information for one of these operations,
 * it returns a simple message "You need to be logged in to do that."
 *
 * This mirrors the message that Discourse returns in this situation, so it may not
 * be necessary. But it may be allowing us to provide a more uniform response. It is a
 * topic that can be investigated if necessary.
 *
 * All of the authenticated queries and mutations are specified below.
 *
 * These primarily consist of mutations, since those are typically the only operations
 * in Discourse that require an authenticated user. The exceptions to this are the queries
 * for notifications, private messages, and badges (which don't make sense for an anonymous
 * user).
 *
 * Also, the `login` mutation does not require an authenticated user, as that is
 * the way in which a user becomes authenticated.
